TODO:

correctness of error-capping
fix and proof the output
better function to map $ at end of found (suff) string to the start index of that string (aka string_start_in_not_backwards_T)
better function to map index anywhere inside found (suff) string to the start index of that string (aka string_start_in_not_backwards_T)
un-confuse the mapping process and standardise things in general
edit distance algorithm should use magical bit whatever to be faster
clean up all that mapping business inside the overlaps() function
program start and arguments cleaned up
output to file instead of console
annotate the code a bit more
clean up the vars saved and created when index is created
checkpoints rank lookup needs to be sped up
check correctness of kucherov Cond 3 filter index
check correctness of index range ep value inclusive?
check correctness of thresh strictly greater than?
check correctness of last character being included in a match?
