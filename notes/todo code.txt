    FIXES

fix the many-ways-to-make-same-match problem introduced by indels





    OVERHAULS



have candidates store the tail-length of the suffix (nonzero for an inclusion)

output format matching what is needed

better function to map $ at end of found (suff) string to the start index of that string (aka string_start_in_not_backwards_T)

better function to map index anywhere inside found (suff) string to the start index of that string (aka string_start_in_not_backwards_T)

un-confuse the mapping process and standardise things in general

edit distance algorithm should use magical bit whatever to be faster

clean up all that mapping business inside the overlaps() function

program start and arguments





    ADDITIONS

annotate the code a bit more

redo verification so that it will be able to cope with negative overlap offsets (and thus handle inclusions)

clean up the vars saved and created when index is created

checkpoints rank lookup needs to be sped up





    CHECK FOR CORRECTNESS

kucherov Cond 3 filter index

index range ep value inclusive?

thresh strictly greater than?

last character being included in a match?
