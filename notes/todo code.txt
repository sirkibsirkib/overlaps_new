TODO: INDENT AS YOU FINISH

better function to map $ at end of found (suff) string to the start index of that string (aka string_start_in_not_backwards_T)

better function to map index anywhere inside found (suff) string to the start index of that string (aka string_start_in_not_backwards_T)

fix the many-ways-to-make-same-match problem introduced by indels

redo verification so that it will be able to cope with negative overlap offsets (and thus handle inclusions)

have candidates store the tail-length of the suffix (nonzero for an inclusion)

clean up the vars saved and created when index is created

edit distance algorithm should use magical bit whatever to be faster

output format matching what is needed

checkpoints rank lookup needs to be sped up

clean up all that mapping business inside the overlaps() function



CHECK THESE FOR ONE-OFF ERRORS
